# ðŸš¨ URGENT SECURITY ACTION REQUIRED

Your secrets have been exposed and need immediate rotation!

## Immediate Actions Required:

### 1. Revoke the GitHub Personal Access Token
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Find the token starting with `github_pat_11AAGQOOA...`
3. Click "Delete" to revoke it immediately
4. Generate a new token with `read:org` and `repo` scopes
5. Save the new token securely

### 2. Update GitHub App Private Key
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/apps/argus-ai-assistant
2. Click "Generate a new private key"
3. Download the new private key
4. Keep it secure and never commit it

### 3. Generate New Webhook Secret
```bash
# Generate a new webhook secret
openssl rand -hex 32
```

### 4. Update Production Secrets
```bash
# Update Cloudflare secrets
wrangler secret put GITHUB_TOKEN
wrangler secret put GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY
wrangler secret put GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

### 5. Update Local Development
1. Update `.dev.vars` with the new secrets
2. Never share or commit this file

## What Happened:
- GitHub Personal Access Token was exposed
- Webhook secret was exposed
- GitHub App private key was exposed

## Prevention:
- Never share screenshots of `.dev.vars` or secret files
- Always use `.dev.vars.example` for documentation
- Use environment variables or secret management tools
- Enable secret scanning on your repository

## Good News:
- The `.dev.vars` file is properly gitignored
- No secrets were committed to the repository
- Only local exposure occurred

**ACT NOW - These secrets are compromised!**
