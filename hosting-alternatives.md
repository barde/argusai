## Recommended Architecture by Scale

### Small Teams (< 100 PRs/day)
**Primary:** Cloudflare Workers + KV
**Alternative:** Google Cloud Run
**Queue:** Native platform queuing
**Cache:** Platform KV/Cache

### Medium Teams (100-1000 PRs/day)
**Primary:** AWS Lambda + SQS
**Alternative:** Azure Container Instances
**Queue:** SQS/Azure Service Bus
**Cache:** ElastiCache/Azure Cache

### Large Teams (> 1000 PRs/day)
**Primary:** Kubernetes (AKS/EKS/GKE)
**Alternative:** Managed container services
**Queue:** Kafka/RabbitMQ
**Cache:** Redis Cluster

## Migration Considerations

When choosing a platform, consider:

1. **Existing Infrastructure**: Leverage current cloud investments
2. **Team Expertise**: Choose platforms your team knows
3. **Compliance Requirements**: Some platforms offer better compliance features
4. **Geographic Distribution**: Edge platforms excel at global distribution
5. **Cost Predictability**: Serverless can have variable costs

## Why We Chose Cloudflare Workers

After evaluating all options, Cloudflare Workers emerged as the optimal choice for ArgoAI because:

1. **Zero Cold Starts**: Critical for GitHub webhook timeouts
2. **Global Edge Network**: Instant response times worldwide
3. **Cost Efficiency**: Often fits within free tier
4. **Simplicity**: Minimal operational overhead
5. **Native Queuing**: Cloudflare Queues integrate seamlessly

For teams with specific requirements or existing infrastructure, the alternatives listed above remain viable options. The modular architecture of ArgoAI allows for relatively easy migration between platforms if needed.
