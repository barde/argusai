# Testing ArgusAI Commenting System

This PR is created to test the ArgusAI bot's commenting capabilities. The test file `commenting-system-test.ts` contains various code patterns designed to trigger different types of review comments.

## Test Scenarios

1. **SQL Injection Vulnerability** - Should trigger a critical security warning
2. **Missing Error Handling** - Should suggest improvements
3. **Performance Issues** - Should identify O(nÂ²) complexity
4. **Good Code Example** - Should receive positive feedback
5. **Style Inconsistencies** - Should point out naming convention issues
6. **Null Reference Risks** - Should warn about potential runtime errors
7. **Hardcoded Credentials** - Should flag as critical security issue
8. **Memory Leak Potential** - Should identify unbounded cache growth

## Expected Bot Behavior

When this PR is created, ArgusAI should:

1. Analyze the test file
2. Post an overall review comment with a verdict
3. Add line-specific comments for each issue found
4. Use appropriate severity indicators (ðŸ”´ Critical, ðŸŸ¡ Important, ðŸŸ¢ Minor)
5. Provide actionable suggestions for improvements

## How to Verify

1. Create the PR
2. Wait for ArgusAI to process (should be within seconds)
3. Check that comments appear on the PR
4. Verify that critical issues (SQL injection, hardcoded credentials) are flagged appropriately
5. Confirm that positive feedback is given for the well-structured UserService class

This test validates that the ArgusAI bot is fully functional and ready for production use.
